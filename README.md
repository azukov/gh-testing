# gh-testing
Used to try out different startegies of code management on GitHub.

We can use different ways to sync

- Just merge PR.
- Merge and squash. 
  This will remove intermediate commits, but will it preserve graph structure on GH?
  It will, but how to sync upstream with origin after PR?
- Finally we can rebase. Although there is no squash option?
